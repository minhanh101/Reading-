The rich dad went on Stanford University,University of Chicago,Northwestern Univerity to study and and other father never finished eighth grade 
The similarities of 2 dads were they was sucessful in  their career,working hard all their life and earned subtanial incomes 
I think the poor dad is the author's biological father 
Two dads mostly disagree about money and education 
Because they had a different point of views about money 
It is one dad say "The love of money is the root of all evil"' and another say " The lack of money is the root of an evil"
the author feels sad when money is not taught in schools
the rich dad insisted:"How can I afford it?".It helps your brain put to work and he'd say "My brain get stronger everyday beacause I exercise it.
The more money I get, the more money I make",he believed that automacially say "I can't afford it"was the sign of mental laziness
The rich dad thought that the rich should be pay more taxes to take care of those less fortunate andbother dad said"Taxes punish those who produce and reward those who don't produce"
One dad said "My house is a liability,if your house is largest investment,you are in trouble" because liability will take money again and again,the larger investment,the more liability they will pay
I think the author decided to listen to the rich dad because the rich dad teach him how money works and learn how to have it work for him
The school the author attended after grade 6 is the private school 
Because they are only the poor kids at this school
