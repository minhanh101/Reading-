The rich dad went on Stanford University,University of Chicago,Northwestern Univerity to study and and other father never finished eighth grade 
The similarities of 2 dads were they was sucessful in  their career,working hard all their life and earned subtanial incomes 
I think the rich dad is the author's biological father 
Two dads mostly disagree about money and education 
Because they had a different point of views about money 
It is one dad say "The love of money is the root of all evil"' and another say " The lack of money is the root of an evil
